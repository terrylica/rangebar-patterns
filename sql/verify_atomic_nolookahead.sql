-- ATOMIC NO-LOOKAHEAD VERIFICATION TEST
-- =============================================================================
-- Purpose: Prove that our expanding-window p95 uses ONLY past data
-- Method:  For ONE specific bar, manually compute what the model would have
--          known at decision time, then compare to SQL window function output
--
-- Pass Criteria:
--   1. manual_p95 = window_p95 (EXACT match within floating point tolerance)
--   2. The bar at test_timestamp is NOT included in manual_p95 computation
--   3. direction lags are verified correct (dir_1 = direction of t-1, etc.)

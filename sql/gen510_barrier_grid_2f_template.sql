-- Gen 510: Barrier Grid on Gen400 2-Feature Winners
--
-- PURPOSE: Sweep TP/SL/max_bars combos on the top Gen400 2-feature configs
-- to find if a different barrier improves Kelly beyond the fixed 2:1 R:R.
--
-- PARAMETERS (substituted by generate.sh via sed):
--   __FEATURE_COL_1__    — First feature column
--   __FEATURE_COL_2__    — Second feature column
--   __QUANTILE_PCT_1__   — First quantile level
--   __QUANTILE_PCT_2__   — Second quantile level
--   __DIRECTION_1__      — First filter direction: > or <
--   __DIRECTION_2__      — Second filter direction: > or <
--   __CONFIG_ID__        — Config identifier
--
-- BARRIER GRID (36 combos via arrayJoin):
--   TP_MULT: 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00
--   SL_MULT: 0.125, 0.25, 0.50
--   MAX_BARS: 20, 50, 100
--
-- QUANTILE: Rolling 1000-signal windows (AP-10 compliant)
